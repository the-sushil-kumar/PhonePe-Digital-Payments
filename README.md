üìä PhonePe Digital Payments Analysis Dashboard

Project Overview

    This project provides a comprehensive, end-to-end analysis of digital 
    payment trends and user adoption across various states in India, 
    using mock/publicly available PhonePe data. The primary goal was 
    to transform raw transactional data into actionable business   
    intelligence using a robust ETL pipeline and a highly interactive 
    Power BI dashboard.
    
    The analysis covers Total Transactions, Registered User Growth, 
    Brand Preferences, and Average Transaction Value, offering 
    insights critical for strategic planning and geographical 
    marketing efforts.

üöÄ Key Features and Deliverables

    Full Pipeline Implementation: Demonstrated proficiency across the entire data lifecycle, 
    from cleaning and transformation to modeling and visualization.
    
    Real-Time Trend Analysis: Visualizing registered user growth and 
    total transactions over time.
    
    Geographic Insights: Identification of high-value states for 
    both transaction volume and user base (e.g., Karnataka, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh).
    
    Performance Metrics: Calculation of key financial indicators like Average 
    Transaction Value (1.35K) and Total Transaction Amount (36.3T).
    
    Optimized Data Model: Creation of a star schema model in Power BI's 
    Model View for efficient querying.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

    Python: Used for Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, specifically for handling 
    null values, data validation, and initial data preparation before ingestion.
    
    SQL: Employed for Query Analysis and Data Aggregation, executing complex queries, 
    filtering, and joining tables to prepare analytical datasets.
    
    Power Query (M Language): Critical for the ETL Process within Power BI, 
    handling efficient Extract, Transform, and Load operations, including 
    data type adjustments and cleaning.
    
    Power BI (Desktop): The core tool for Data Modeling and Visualization, used 
    for connecting data sources, building the model, and creating the final 
    interactive reports.
    
    DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized for Metric Calculation‚Äîcreating 
    calculated columns and complex measures (e.g., Year-over-Year growth, 
    Ratios, Key Performance Indicators).
    
    Model View: Essential for Database Design, used to set up an optimized data model 
    (relationships, cardinalities, filtering direction) to ensure report performance.

üìà Key Insights & Metrics

    Based on the final dashboard, the following observations were made:
    
    Massive Scale: The dashboard visualizes over 36.3T in total transaction 
    value, underscoring the massive scale of digital adoption.
    
    User Growth Peak: Registered User growth was highest in 2020,
    demonstrating rapid expansion during that period.
    
    State Dominance: While Maharashtra and Karnataka drive high transaction values,
    states like Uttar Pradesh show significant promise with large registered user populations.
    
    Brand Loyalty: Devices from Xiaomi and Vivo account for the largest share 
    of registered user devices.
